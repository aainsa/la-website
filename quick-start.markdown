<h4>Quick start to install, tune and maintain a LA Portal</h4>

To install and maintain a Living Atlas Portal was not an easy task, but now is more easy than newer. Using the [LA Toolkit](https://github.com/living-atlases/la-toolkit) you can have a LA Portal in a pair of hours. Checkout the [LA Toolkit demo](https://toolkit-demo.l-a.site/) and the [infrastructure requirements](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation/wiki/Infrastructure-Requirements).

See a screencast of the toolkit part of [its public presentation](https://datos.gbif.es/others/la-toolkit-gbif-presentation-2021.html):

Or just [install the LA Tookit](https://github.com/living-atlases/la-toolkit#prerequisites) in your computer to start with the deployment of a test or a production LA Portal.


Also we have a [quick start guide](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation/wiki/LA-Quick-Start-Guide) in our wiki with an in depth description of the common steps that a LA new portal requires to accomplish in order to be production ready.
