#### Description 

Funded through the GBIF CESP program, the workshop aimed to train data holders and data users on data cleaning, enrichment, publication and re-use. The data use section of the workshop focused on discovering the functionalities of an ALA based portal (Canadensys) and the GBIF portal. For the ALA portal, we focused on the search and download options and presented the modules available in the ALA framework.

This workshop took place in November 2018 and was held at the Unversity of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia
