#### Description 

This online workshop focused on end-users. We proposeed live demonstration of Living Atlas data portals. This workshop helped Living Atlases participants to promote their data portal, but also for people interested in the tools to discover the possibility given by a platform based on the Atlas of Living Australia toolset.

#### Participants

As the workshop was online, without a mandatory registration, it is difficult to have a list of participants. However, we know that we had around 70 viewers during the entire session.
