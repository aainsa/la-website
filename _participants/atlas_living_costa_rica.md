[![Atlas of Living Costa Rica - CRBio](/assets/img/participants/atlas_living_costa_rica.png)](http://www.crbio.cr/)

#### Description 
The [Atlas of Living Costa Rica](http://www.crbio.cr/) was launched in 2006 aiming at providing integrated, free, and open access to data and information about the Costa Rican biodiversity in order to support science, education, and biodiversity conservation. In 2016, it was rebuild with software components developed by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). The Atlas is managed by the **Biodiversity Informatics Research Center (CRBio)** and the **National Biodiversity Institute (INBio)**.

Nowadays, the Atlas of Living Costa Rica includes nearly seven million georeferenced species occurrence records, mediated by the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](http://www.gbif.org), which come from more than 900 databases and have been published by research centers in 36 countries. Half of those records are published by Costa Rican institutions. In addition, CRBio is making a special effort to enrich and share more than 5000 species pages, developed by INBio, about Costa Rican vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes, plants and fungi.

Four developers are currently working on the portal.
