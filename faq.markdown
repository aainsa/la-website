#### What is the Atlas of Living Australia and its infrastructure?

"The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is a collaborative, digital, open infrastructure that pulls together Australian biodiversity data from multiple sources, making it accessible and reusable." You will find more information on the Atlas of Living Australia and its infrastructe on [their website](https://www.ala.org.au/about-ala/). Since 2013, they modified their infrastructure to be modulable, international and reusable by other institutions. 

#### What is the GBIF?

"The Global Biodiveristy Information Facility (GBIF) is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth". You will find more information [here](https://www.gbif.org/what-is-gbif). 

#### What is the Living Atlases community?

The Living Atlases community has been created by GBIF nodes, and institution that are interested to use the ALA tools as national or thematics data portal. The main goal is create a powerful community of developers that can helps each others, developed new features that can be useful for the entire community, and improved the main project. You will find more information on the [About page of this website](../about/). 

#### I want to join the community, what do I need to do?

First, welcome! We are happy to know that you are interested and want to join the community! The first step is to contact both the technical and administrative coordinators. They will be able to help you with the first technical steps, and add you the Slack Channel where you will be able to ask any questions you may have. 

We will recommand you to register to the [mailing-list](https://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/ala-portal). You will get all the information regarding project calls and future potential workshops. 

The community set up different tools and documentation that might help you install your Living Atlas instance as the Generator-living-atlas (more information [here](https://github.com/living-atlases/generator-living-atlas)) or the LA Quick Start Guide (more information [here](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation/wiki/LA-Quick-Start-Guide)). You can contact Vicente to organize a remote session to know more about the tools and the installation process. You will find more information [here](https://tinyurl.com/la-bootstrap-sessions). 


#### Is it free to use the ALA platform?

The Atlas of Living Australia infrastructure is an open source project is open source project, so it is free to use and reuse it. But, you will need to use the same licenses. All the tools, remote sessions and helpdesk are free to use. 

However, as for all technical projects, the installation and maintenance of a data portal based on the ALA platform is not free. You will need to have servers and at least one developer dedicated to the project. Even if the ALA team and the community put a huge effort to facilitate the installation of the tool, it is still a powerful and complex infrastructure. You will need at least one technical staff dedicated to this. 

As we want to be a powerful community, you wrote a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and we accept financial or in-kind contribution. These contributions will help use organize technical workshops, remote sessions, translation or documentations. If you need more information, you can contact the administrative coordinator. You can find the MoU overhere.


#### I have technical questions, who do I need to contact? 

To ask technical questions, you can use:
- the ALA Slack Channel (#gbif-node-developers). You can contact the technical coordinator if you need an invitation to join the Slack Channel. _This is the recommand way to ask a technical question_
- The Mailing list, even if we use it more for workshop organization and news. 
- Contacting directly the technical coordinator. 

#### Do I need to be a GBIF node to be part of the community?

No, even if GBIF support us, you don't need to be part of GBIF to join the communauty. However, we will promote data management and data tools (such as the IPT) developed by GBIF and its network. 

#### Does the tools internationalizable?

Yes, thanks to the Living Atlases community, the ALA tools has been translated in several language. You can find more information on the Crowdin project page. The community proposed a management system for the internationalization of a Living Atlases (more information [here](https://github.com/living-atlases/ala-i18n))

#### Where can I find the technical documentation?  

Everything is available on the ALA GitHub technical wiki, we will recommand you to start with [the LA Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation/wiki/LA-Quick-Start-Guide). We know that the technical documentation is not prefect, and we put a huge effort to improve it as much as we can. Different tools has been developed to help developers to use the ALA platform.
