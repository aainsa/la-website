#### Description 

CoopBioPlat is a Pilot Coordination Action supported by the [ERANet-LaC Project](http://eranet-lac.eu/Pilot_Coordination_Actions.php) (funded by the European Commission) and it aims to:

- reach an institutional agreement to cooperate on biodiversity data portals (national, based on ALA); and
- demonstrate technical cooperation and progress in that area.

The project included a first meeting in June 2015 held in Argentina that focused on a multilateral Memorandum of Understanding, and a technical workshop in October 2015 held at the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid (Spain) focused on moving forward on the development of national data portals based on ALA.

Progress was also made in the documentation and internationalization tasks in coordination with the [Encounter Bay project]().
